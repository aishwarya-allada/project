                 Social Science is a branch of science that deals with the institutions 
and functioning of human society and with the interpersonal relationships
of individuals as members of society and also it's a science dealing 
with a particular phase or aspect of human society.
            
                 The social science has generally been regarded as a category of science that 
accommodates solely the disciplines which study Man in relation to his social 
environment for the purpose of formulating laws, generalisations and more 
importantly to make predictions on the future actions of Man.

                 Social Science help people understand how to analyze not only their own behavior 
but also the behavior and motivations of their peers. The social sciences also 
give us a better understanding of how to create more inclusive and effective institutions.
